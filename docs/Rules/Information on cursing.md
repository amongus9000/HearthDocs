# Information on cursing

**Swearing is allowed in the server, as long as it is only used as an expression, it is not used excessively, and it is not directed towards other players.**
* For example, if someone says, “ah shit, here we go again”, it is okay because it is only used as an expression.
* If someone says “all of you are shitheads”, it is not okay because it is directed towards other players.
* If someone says “oh fucking hell, this piece of shitty ass lava killed me”, although it is used as an expression, it is not okay because it is excessive and toxic.
* Acronyms including, but not limited to “ffs” or “wtf” is okay, unless it is used towards other players.
