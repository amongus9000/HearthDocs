# Grief Prevention

This plugin allows players to claim their builds to prevent others from griefing them. Players gain 500 claim blocks per hour up to a total of 62,500. More claim blocks can be purchased by using the command **/buyclaim blocks [amount]**.

To make a claim, start by typing in **/kit claim** to gain a claim shovel and claim stick.
Next you'll want to right click while looking at one corner of the area you want to claim, and then right click the opposite corner to create an imaginary square that will encompass your build.

Example:
