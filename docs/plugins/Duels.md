# Duels

This plugin allows you to challenge another player to a 1 on 1 duel using various pre-made kits. You don't lose items, money or xp for losing a duel, just bragging rights.

Duel challenges can be sent by type the command **/duel [player]** and then choosing a kit from the GUI menu that opens up.
