# Custom Join Messages

This plugin allows donators to set their own custom join and leave messages to show in the chat. You're able to purchase a join/leave message individually, or you can get a set of them when you buy specific ranks in the real money store.

You can access these buy doing **/buy** in-game or by going to [store.hearthcraft.net](https://store.hearthcraft.net/).

Once purchased, you may ask an Administrator of the server to set the messages to your liking.
