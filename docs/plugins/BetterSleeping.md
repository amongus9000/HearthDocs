# Better Sleeping

This plugin alleviates the issues of trying to get everyone online to sleep at the same time. Its currently set up to require only a percentage of all the online players to sleep so the server can skip night. 

All that's required of you is to sleep when its nighttime, and a message will be sent to everyone in the server that a player is trying to skip the night. Once the required amount of players are sleeping, night will skip like normal.
