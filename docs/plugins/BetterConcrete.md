# Better Concrete

This plugin is a quality-of-life improvement for converting concrete powder into concrete. Instead of having to place 1 powder at a time to convert it, this plugin allows you to throw 3 stacks of concrete powder into a cauldron to convert instantly.

Cauldrons have 3 levels of water, each level will convert 1 stack of concrete up to a maximum of 3. There are no commands relevant to this plugin.
