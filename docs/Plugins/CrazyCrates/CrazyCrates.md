# Crazy Crates

This plugin is a crate reward system. Players can use keys that they have obtained from various sources on the crates to win randomized prizes. Each crate has its own pool of items that can be won, all with different percentage chances to win.

The crate area can be visited by typing **/warp crates** in-game or by going to spawn with **/spawn** and walking towards the area.

In the sub pages, there will be a list of each crates rewards and how to obtain keys for each crate.
