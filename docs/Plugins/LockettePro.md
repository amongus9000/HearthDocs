# Lockette Pro

This plugin allows players to lock chests and doors with just a single sign. You can add users to the sign to allow sharing with only specific players, as well as doors. Doors can also be set with timers so the door will close after the specified time in seconds passes.


To get started, all you need to do is right click a chest with a sign and it will place a lock on it. 

If you would like to give players access to the locked chest, **right click** the sign with an **empty hand** to select it, and then type the command **/lock [line number] [player name]** to add them to the chest.

Example: /lock 3 Simonee

Since there are only 4 lines to each sign, you can only add up to an additional 2 players per sign, but if you right click with a sign on another side of the chest, you can add up to another 4 players with the same command. You can continue doing this until every side of the chest (or double chest) is filled with signs.

Alternatively, you can type **/lock 3 [everyone]** and it will open the chest to the public.

If you would like to lock a door, place a sign on the block directly above the door to achieve a similar outcome.


#### Additional information

* If you are wanting to place a sign on a chest that *isnt* a lock sign, you can sneak right click to place it like you would normally.
