# Deluxe Tags

This plugins allows you to add a little bit of flair to your name in chat. You can get tags from events, giveaways or by using tag keys obtained through crates.

Once obtained, use the command **/tags** to access your personal collection of tags. Click on one to apply and then type in chat to see how it looks.

You can disable your tag at anytime by clicking the middle button at the bottom of the **/tags** GUI menu.

You are also able to buy custom made tags from the store. To access the store either type **/buy** in-game or go to [store.hearthcraft.net](
https://store.hearthcraft.net).

Once purchased, contact a server Administrator to have your custom tag created.
