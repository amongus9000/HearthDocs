# Advanced Anti-Cheat

AAC is HearthCraft's main plugin for detecting and punishing cheaters on the server. The plugin uses algorithms which track every player on the server, and sends notices to staff when someone is doing something they shouldn't.

As with everything, false positives are common. If you think you have been unfairly punished, we have a ticket system on our discord where you can appeal your punishment and provide proof to back up your claim.

We do not guarantee that a ban appeal will succeed, but we will do our best to make sure any punishment we make is justified.
